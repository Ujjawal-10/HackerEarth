FREDO AND ARRAY UPDATE:->

Given an array arr[] of N elements, the task is to update all the elements of the given array to some value X such that the sum of all the updated array elements is strictly greater than the sum of all the elements of the initial array and X is the minimum possible.

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = {4, 2, 1, 10, 6} 
Output: 5 
Sum of original array = 4 + 2 + 1 + 10 + 6 = 23 
Sum of the modified array = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 25

Input: arr[] = {9876, 8654, 5470, 3567, 7954} 
Output: 7105
